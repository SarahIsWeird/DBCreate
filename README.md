# DBCreate

Easily create new databases for your project!

I got fed up with having to execute the same SQL statements over and over again for every device I needed to test an
application on, so I cobbled together this little program to help out.

## Usage

The program is pretty self-explanatory. Enter the login information of the root user and click `Login`. Then, enter
the information about the new database. Click the button `Create database` and your database and the user will be
created! When the database has been created, the `Create database` button will turn cyan (mint?).
